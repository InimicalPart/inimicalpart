  Hello! My name is InimicalPart (I usually go by Inimi) and I work on front-end and back-end development. I have created some projects, for example a <a href="https://github.com/InimicalPart/InBot">Discord Bot</a> for one of the servers that I moderate, <a href="https://inimicalpart.com">My personal website</a>, and some others! If you have a question to ask me or just want to talk then don't hesitate to contact me on my email (<a href="mailto:me@inimicalpart.com?subject=Hello good friend c;">me@inimicalpart.com</a>).
